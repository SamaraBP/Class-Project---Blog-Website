# Class-Project---Blog-Website
Blog website class project.

Thank you for checking out my project! 
Requires Node.

As it exists now, to run open your CLI and navagate to the project folder and run node on the app.js folder to start the server.
~node app.js
Then open any web browser and type
localhost:3000
into the address bar to bring up the site. 

Currently lacking a database to save blog posts after closing but will be added soon.
